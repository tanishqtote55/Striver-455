    ### üìö Introduction to Dynamic Programming (DP)

    **Dynamic Programming (DP)** is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant work.

    ---

    ### üîÅ Why Use Dynamic Programming?

    Many problems have **overlapping subproblems** and **optimal substructure**. Solving such problems using brute force leads to exponential time complexity. DP solves them efficiently by:

    1. **Avoiding recomputation** (by storing results in a table - also called **memoization** or **tabulation**).
    2. **Reusing previously computed results** for solving larger problems.

    ### ‚úåÔ∏è Two Key Properties of DP Problems

    | Property                       | Explanation                                                                                     |
    | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | 1. **Overlapping Subproblems** | The problem can be broken down into smaller, reusable subproblems.                              |
    | 2. **Optimal Substructure**    | The optimal solution of the overall problem depends on the optimal solution of its subproblems. |

    ### ‚öîÔ∏è Approaches in DP

    | Approach                      | Description                                                             |
    | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | 1. **Top-Down (Memoization)** | Solve the problem recursively and store the results of subproblems.     |
    | 2. **Bottom-Up (Tabulation)** | Solve subproblems first and use them to build the solution iteratively. |

    ### üõ†Ô∏è Basic Template for DP (Memoization)

    ```cpp
    int dp[n+1]; // initialized to -1
    int solve(int n) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) return n;

        if (dp[n] != -1) return dp[n];

        return dp[n] = solve(n - 1) + solve(n - 2);
    }
    ```

    ### üìà Time Complexity Benefits

    | Approach    | Time Complexity (e.g., Fibonacci) |
    | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
    | Brute Force | Exponential `O(2^n)`              |
    | With DP     | Linear `O(n)`                     |

    ### üí° Tips to Master DP

    * Learn to **identify subproblems**.
    * Try both **memoization and tabulation** for a problem.
    * Draw **state transition diagrams** or tables.
    * Practice standard problems (see Leetcode, GFG, Striver‚Äôs DP Series).
    * Understand **space optimization** (using fewer variables instead of arrays).
