/*
    127. Word Ladder
    A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:
    Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
    Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
    sk == endWord
    Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

    Example 1:
    Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.

    Example 2:
    Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
    
    Constraints:

    1 <= beginWord.length <= 10
    endWord.length == beginWord.length
    1 <= wordList.length <= 5000
    wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
    beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
    beginWord != endWord
    All the words in wordList are unique.
